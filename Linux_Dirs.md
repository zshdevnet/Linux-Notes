## /bin

Contains essential binaries (executables) needed for basic system operation, like basic commands (ls, cp, mv). These are commands needed by all users and are available even in single-user mode.

## /boot
Contains files required for the system to boot, including the Linux kernel, initrd images, and bootloader configuration files. Modifying or deleting files here can prevent the system from booting.

## /cdrom
A legacy mount point for CD-ROMs, sometimes used for optical media or external media.

## /dev
Contains device files, which represent hardware and virtual devices. For example, /dev/sda might represent a hard disk, while /dev/tty is a terminal interface.

## /etc
Contains system-wide configuration files for applications, services, and the system itself. Examples include passwd, fstab, and systemd configuration files. Files in /etc are often text files, and changes to them affect system behavior.

## /home
Stores personal directories for each user on the system (e.g., /home/username). Each user’s data and personal files are stored here.

## /lib and /lib64
Contains essential libraries needed by binaries in /bin and /sbin, specifically for the system’s architecture. /lib64 holds 64-bit libraries. These are symbolic links to /usr/lib and /usr/lib64 in your system, meaning that both folders point to those directories in /usr.

## /lost+found
A directory used by the fsck utility to store files recovered after file system corruption. Each file system has its lost+found directory, commonly in the root of the disk.

## /media
A mount point for removable media such as USB drives, CDs, and DVDs. Typically, each device connected to the system is automatically mounted under /media with a unique directory name.

## /mnt
A generic mount point that can be used for mounting temporary file systems, such as network drives or additional disks. Admins often use this directory when mounting filesystems manually.

## /opt
Used for optional or third-party software packages. For example, if you install software that isn’t managed by the package manager, it often goes here.

## /proc
A virtual file system providing information about running processes and system status, dynamically generated by the kernel. Files here represent kernel data structures and are mainly read-only, like /proc/cpuinfo for CPU information.

## /root
The home directory for the root user (system administrator), separate from /home to allow root to access it even when /home is on another partition.

## /run
A temporary filesystem (often a tmpfs) that holds runtime data for processes and services. It is typically cleared at boot, and applications store process IDs (PIDs) and socket files here.

## /sbin
Contains essential system binaries used for system administration, such as ifconfig, iptables, and shutdown. Like /bin, these are needed for system maintenance but are generally reserved for the root user.

## /snap
A directory used by the Snap package manager, containing Snap application data. Snap packages are self-contained applications supported by many Linux distributions.

## /srv
Contains data for services offered by the system, such as web servers (e.g., apache or nginx might store data here) and FTP servers.

## swap.img
A swap file used for virtual memory, allowing the system to offload inactive memory pages to disk. The system uses it when physical RAM is full.

## /sys
Another virtual file system similar to /proc, used to provide information about devices, drivers, and kernel features. It represents and exposes the kernel’s view of the hardware.

## /tmp
A temporary directory for files that are only needed temporarily. Most systems clear /tmp on reboot, so it’s used for temporary application data.

## /usr
Contains user-installed software and libraries. This directory is often large, holding subdirectories like /usr/bin for applications, /usr/lib for libraries, and /usr/share for shared resources.

## /var
Holds variable data that changes frequently, such as logs (/var/log), caches (/var/cache), mail, and print spooler files. Logs and other dynamic data are stored here.
